# Survey Benchmarks

Some of the surveys conducted on the Twine/FrontlineSMS platform have national benchmarks that their results may be compared against.

These benchmark numbers are provided by the Twine API for the FrontlineSMS dashboard. The numbers are updated annually. At the moment, the static files are stored in `/database/static/20**_(cls|nps)_benchmarks.json`, and read in the relevant seed files.
