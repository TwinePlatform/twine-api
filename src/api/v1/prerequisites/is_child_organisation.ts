/*
 * "organisation_details-child" route pre-requisite
 *
 * Determines if the authenticated user is trying to access an organisation
 * which is actually a "child" entity.
 *
 * Conditions under which this is true for organisation X:
 * - User is an admin for X
 * - User is an admin for a funding body which owns at least
 *   one funding programme of which X is a member
 * - User is a Twine admin
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - This route pre-requisite is run _AFTER_ the organisation in question
 *   is fetched and placed in the `pre` object under one of the following keys:
 *   > organisation
 *   > communityBusiness
 *   > fundingBody
